 The entire app is basically handled by this one big fat View Controller. The idea is that users don't leave the context to do their settings.
 
 There are two "screens" that appear: The Appearance Editor (font, color), and the Alarm Editor (alarm time, activation, sound). These are actually
 hidden screens that appear over the main display screen.
 
 Yeah, it's a big ugly mess. Read the README to find out why the app is configured this way.
